# Trailblazer Coders

## About
This code repository was created to assist with elementary school education in coding. A working version is hosted using the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) cloud hosting platform and can be visited at [Trailblazer Coders](https://trailblazer-coders.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation Instructions
These are by no means exhaustive installation instructions. They assume a basic knowledge of using a command prompt or terminal application. See the [Windows PowerShell and Unix/Apple Terminal Basics](#windows-powerShell-and-unixapple-terminal-basics) section for some basic commands that should help you get up and running.

1. Get the code
    * If you are familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can clone this repository with the following command:  
    `git clone https://github.com/bradhuber1/trailblazer.git`
    * Otherwise, you can download and extract the code from this [zip](https://github.com/bradhuber1/trailblazer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file 
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * This application is built and run using the Node.js JavaScript Runtime environment
3. Open a command prompt or terminal to install the code
    * On Windows use either *Command Prompt* or *PowerShell* (recommended)
4. Install the *Trailblazer* application development environment
    * Using *Windows PowerShell*
        1. Change directories (folders) to the trailblazer directory (previously downloaded and unzipped):  
        `cd path/to/trailblazer`
        2. Run the install command:  
        `npm install`
        3. Run the application:  
        `npm start`
        4. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Make Code Changes
1. Install a text/code editor or Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to edit code
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a cross-platform and easy to use code editor
2. Once changes are complete, re-start the application (if the application is running use the ***CTRL+C*** in the command prompt or terminal to stop it), then run the following command:  
`npm start`

## Windows PowerShell and Unix/Apple Terminal Basics
* To see the path of where you are in the file system run the following command:  
`pwd`
* To change directories:  
`cd path/to/directory`
* To go back to the home directory:  
`cd`
* To go back one directory:  
`cd ..`
* To go back two directories:  
`cd ../..`
* To see (list) what is in the current directory:  
`ls`
